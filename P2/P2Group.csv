2,"Luciano Wolff,Reynaldo Garcia",20,"Our project would be a game were you would be given a plot of land next to a river. The player would be playing the role of a villain who has to contaminate the river as much as possible without alerting the authorities or getting an uprising from its citizens. The river gets polluted by the construction of building such as factories, farmlands, etc. The game would be constructed this way so the players are encourage to see the different harmful effects that come from different structures and processes. The river would have a health bar and it would replete its own life if it isn't contained fast enough, with the goal of the game being taking it to 0. the negative effects that would come from building would reflect the real-life negative impacts these have on bodies of water such as pesticides going into the river or trash being deposited into the river by a nearby city. Likewise, the building updates in the game would present real life solutions that can be taken in order to reduce the negative impact on bodies of water such as updating the city with a water treatment facility so that the sewers waters dont pollute any nearby bodies of water. every consequence and solution will be explained in a short paragraph in the appropriate building window. When a player finishes playing our game they will be educated on the real life impact of cities, farms and factories on bodies of water such as rivers and more importantly the ways in which such negative impacts can be reduced or completely prevented",https://github.com/RayGar/VR-Project2,"Thu, April 19",https://goo.gl/forms/Pk2BKehiDePV4q2p1
3,"Amitsingh Pardeshi,Jonathan Bouligny,Prerit Datta",2,Building an interactive unity game in order to build a village by making it rain artificially to get the water for the villagers. Also finding the already existing water resources in the area. Storing the rain water into the lake by creating aqueducts and cleaning the water resource(lake) so that lake water can be kept clean which can be used by villagers.,#,"Tue, April 10",https://goo.gl/forms/q6yuKyj2ckBJ5VLn1
4,"Michael Acosta,Christine Huber,Trent Myers",20,"We plan on creating a first person survival game that focus around two main objectives; keeping Water pollution below a certain threshold and building enough Civilization points to advance. Collecting resources allows you to build up your civilization, but this will also cause water pollution. Natural disasters and destruction will be randomly triggered as leveling progresses; some of these caused by pollution, such as acid rain. All buildings can contribute to increasing pollution, but some will decrease pollution - such as water treatment plants. For educational purposes, we are going to include text explanations to what is causing the water pollution to increase. If at any time, the water pollution levels exceed a certain threshold, the player loses the game. Once the player reaches the max civilization level and passes the final natural disaster, they win the game.",https://github.com/Trentm95/CS4331-VR/tree/master/IslandSurvivalProject02,"Thu, April 17",https://goo.gl/forms/etCzCaiS2SYeYWMj2
5,"Derek Fritz,Joyelle Woodson",20,"we plan on creating a game where the user needs to evacuate a city/town in an severe weather scenario. In this sense, we are developing a project that includes the resource-management and game system qualities of the 2nd option, while also incorporating the evacuation scenario of option 4. Additional features may include different options for evacuation, real-time strategy game components, and developing various playable units that aid in the rescue game.",https://github.com/joyellealina/VRGame/tree/master,"Thu, April 17",https://goo.gl/forms/DIaF31uo8MqtydQq2
6,"Jakob Dozier,Mayur Maheshkumar Bhakta,Simon Menbere Woldemichael,xujia wu",1,"In our project, we would like to have a multi-level game (at least 2) in which the player would replicate the processes of the hydrologic cycle on multiple types of water bodies. For example, the player would first be taught on level one, in great detail, exactly how the hydrologic cycle takes place. As there are variations in this process for different types of terrains and water bodies (aqueducts vs. lakes vs. oceans vs. areas with minimal thermal exposure), the player would be challenged to figure out what the optimal method of beginning the cycle and following the process to ensure that all parts of the cycle are going on. Throughout the process, the player would be ranked based on speed, how effective they are in controlling and monitoring the cycle given certain environment variables (heat, map size, terrain obstacles). Since heat is a key element in causing the water cycle (the catalyst for a rain shower, snowstorm, hurricane, hailstorm, etc.) there would be a central item that would provide the user control over this heating element. Depending on how hot or cold it is and what type of water body the game has selected for the player would control what type of precipitation the user should aim for",https://github.com/WebGLHitASnag/VR-Project-2,"Tue, April 10",https://goo.gl/forms/AwTBiO0iAU4Kyzkr1
7,"Benjamin Fox Bolduc,Scott Blechman",5,"The project will be an AR app on the iPhone, a game playable using the Texas Tech campus. We will load a topography/elevation map of the campus onto the scene, and fill it with virtual water over the course of a couple of minutes. The player will need to use this time to safely make it to higher ground, avoiding as much water as possible. The player will receive points for successfully evacuating, and points will be reduced for entering potentially dangerous situations such as crossing flooded roads. Scores will be synced to a cloud server and associated with anonymous IDs, though the IDs can be replaced by player names if they so choose.",https://github.com/scottblechman/flood-safety-simulation,"Thu, April 12",https://goo.gl/forms/MDnxxx1fBFXa4tVE2
