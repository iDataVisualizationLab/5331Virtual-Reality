Luciano Wolff,2,"Our project would be a game were you would be given a plot of land next to a river. The player would be playing the role of a villain who has to contaminate the river as much as possible without alerting the authorities or getting an uprising from its citizens. The river gets polluted by the construction of building such as factories, farmlands, etc. The game would be constructed this way so the players are encourage to see the different harmful effects that come from different structures and processes. The river would have a health bar and it would replete its own life if it isn't contained fast enough, with the goal of the game being taking it to 0. ",,
