Luciano Wolff,2,"Our project would be a game were you would be given a plot of land next to a river. The player would be playing the role of a villain who has to contaminate the river as much as possible without alerting the authorities or getting an uprising from its citizens. The river gets polluted by the construction of building such as factories, farmlands, etc. The game would be constructed this way so the players are encourage to see the different harmful effects that come from different structures and processes. The river would have a health bar and it would replete its own life if it isn't contained fast enough, with the goal of the game being taking it to 0. the negative effects that would come from building would reflect the real-life negative impacts these have on bodies of water such as pesticides going into the river or trash being deposited into the river by a nearby city. Likewise, the building updates in the game would present real life solutions that can be taken in order to reduce the negative impact on bodies of water such as updating the city with a water treatment facility so that the sewers’ waters don’t pollute any nearby bodies of water. every consequence and solution will be explained in a short paragraph in the appropriate building window. When a player finishes playing our game they will be educated on the real life impact of cities, farms and factories on bodies of water such as rivers and more importantly the ways in which such negative impacts can be reduced or completely prevented",,
