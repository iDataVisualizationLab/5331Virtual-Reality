           <td><b>Roto VR – Interactive Virtual Reality Chair</b><br>
              Roto VR enables its users to explore in all possible directions and discover the gravitational presence in a VR environment. Roto has been specifically designed for all HMDs. Instead of just using the headset to navigate around a space, the motorized chair allows one to rotate and turn in the virtual environment. This feature makes it perfect for coordination meetings or navigating through a space.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><b>360 Degree (Omnidirectional) Treadmills</b><br>
                The treadmill I will be covering in depth is the Virtuix Omni, while comparing it to other existing treadmill solutions. The idea behind these treadmills in general is that a user is held (usually at the waist /chest) to insure they don't fall over when moving around. The Omni treadmill has little friction to enable the user to walk/run in any direction when used with the appropriate shoes and shoe trackers. The curvature of the treadmill makes it so that the user is moved towards the center when they are moving around. It simulates the movements in games/applications, even when the movements are running, walking or just crouching. Other systems such as Vue VR even support jumping on top of the other movements. The nice thing about the Virtuix Omni and similar systems is how little room they consume, just like treadmills at a gym, where you can have multiple side by side (as shown below).</td>

        <tr>
            <td><b>Birdly – Ultimate Dream of Flying</b><br>
                a full-body virtual reality flight simulator that uses multi-hinged flaps and motion feedback to give you a taste of flying like a bird.
                Birdly includes a fan in front of the user that regulates the speed of the headwind based on how fast you’re flying.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><b>Magic Bench</b><br>
                Magic Bench allows for a group to share the same augmented environment with any computer-generated graphics and interact in a shared story sequence through a third-person POV. It’s a combined augmented and mixed reality experience. But, what makes this experience interesting is that it does not involve wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) or using a handheld device. Instead, the surroundings are instrumented rather than the individual, allowing people to share the magical experience as a group.

        <tr>
            <td><b>Osso VR</b><br>
                Osso VR is a virtual reality application that uses the Oculus Rift to simulate device procedures and try to replace the current methods. As stated in the video, it’s common for an orthopaedic surgeon to go to a training seminar where demoes are provided by the device manufacturers and the surgeons get to use the device on a cadaver. Then, if the surgeon likes it, the next time they’ll interact with the device will usually be in surgery 4-6 months down the line. By having a VR environment, a surgeon would not only be able to cut out the 2 day seminar to try out the device, as the training would be available to them with the software, but it would also allow them to repeat the procedure many times to help them overcome the learning curve of the complicated procedure.

        <tr>
            <td><b>Sketch AR | Art with Mixed Reality</b><br>
                SketchAR is an application that applied Augmented Reality to create art works in real world. When the user is using the device, he will be able to draw images, just like tracing. The image outline is projected on the selected space, which will be used as the canvas. This app is a very simple but effective usage of augmented reality. While this can be used as a fun application, it can also help people to create high quality copies of existing art and also reproduce them easily on a massive scale. This application is also available for other platforms such as iOS, Android, etc. But among all these, Hololens seems to be the most suitable place to use this app.
